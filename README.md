Recycler is a web application built to help achieve Sustainable Development Goals 12 & 13, enabling people to recycle their recycleable wastes. We act as a middleman between companies that make use of or recycle these wastes and individuals and businesses with wastes to recycle. Using our website, users can can sign up and locate recycling partners closest to their location through Google Maps. Our agents can then pick up these recyclable waste at different collection centres and deliver to the factory. This application is equally designed to help reduce pollution of the enviroments leading to erosion caused by blocked drainage pathways with plastics and other waste materials, inspired by the SDGs targets to strengthen resilience against climate-related hazards and natural disasters, and substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse, by 2030. Together, we can make a difference in the environment!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
